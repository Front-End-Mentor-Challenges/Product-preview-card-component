### What I learned

I did learn to explore more of CSS properties to make this challenge. Did some trial and errors. and for me, using

```css
.image_container {
  background-image: url();
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

has become more suitable for me to use it in this challenge to make the image a bit more responsive from desktop to mobile view.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
